## 🎯 **Assessment Task: Primary Task**

You are a **data science consultant**. A client company provides a dataset and business questions. You must develop an **explanatory data analysis pipeline** using a **Jupyter Notebook** to help answer these questions.

### The notebook must include:

1. **Business Context**

   * Who is your client?
   * What kind of data do they have?
   * Why do they need a data scientist?

2. **Data Exploration**

   * Discuss characteristics of the dataset
   * Identify data quality issues and interesting metadata

3. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Describe how you cleaned and prepared the dataset before analysis

4. **Explanatory Data Analysis**

   * Define **5–10 meaningful business questions**
   * Each question should:

     * Be relevant to business
     * Demonstrate different **Python/Pandas** skills
     * Include:

       * Subsection with question
       * Explanation of its importance to the business
       * Code cell with analysis
       * Text cell with code explanation, results interpretation, and insights

5. **Final Discussion & Conclusion**

   * Summarize strengths and limitations of your analysis
   * Provide insights and actionable recommendations
   * Reflect on the impact of your findings for the business

## 🛠 **Guidelines**

* Keep structure and writing quality high
* Explain design decisions clearly (intuitively or via experiments)
* You may take **inspiration** from public resources (blogs, open-source), but your work **must be your own**
* Submission must demonstrate **your full understanding**
* **Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) are not allowed** unless explicitly permitted

---

## 📂 **Dataset Guidelines**

* If choosing your own dataset:

  * Use a **new dataset** not used in exercises
  * Include **URL** in your submission for verification

## 👥 **Group Work Rules (if applicable)**

> *(Not applicable if this is individual work – but included for completeness)*

* Group size: **2 students**
* Contributions must be equal and transparent
* Group member contributions must be:

  * Clearly stated in the report
  * Evident in the GitHub repo via account activity
